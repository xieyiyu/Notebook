### 两数之和
[Leetcode : 1. Two Sum (Easy)](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

>Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.  
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.  
>  
>Example:  
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,  
Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

```python
def twoSum(nums, target):
    dic = {}
    if len(nums) <= 1:
        return false
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        tmp = target - nums[i]
        if tmp in dic:
            return [dic[tmp], i]
        else:
            dic[nums[i]] = i
```
